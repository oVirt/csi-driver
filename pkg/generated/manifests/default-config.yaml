# Label selector that matches nodes where pods with controller components
# (provisioner, attacher) are allowed to run. These pods typically have some
# privileged access to the storage backend to attach/detach and create/delete
# volumes and some deployments require such pods to run on dedicated nodes,
# so a node compromised by an user does not have a pod that has credentials
# to the storage backend.
