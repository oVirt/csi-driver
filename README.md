# oVirt CSI driver

Implementation of a CSI driver for oVirt.

This work is a continuation of the work done in github.com/ovirt/ovirt-openshift-extensions, 
and is the future of the development of a storage driver for oVirt.

This repo also contains an operator to deploy the driver on OpenShift or Kubernetes 
with most of the code based on openshift/csi-operator.
